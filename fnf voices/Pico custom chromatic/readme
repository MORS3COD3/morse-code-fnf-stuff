When using this chromatic, simply doing a dull auto slice and nothing more in FL studio's slicex will not work.
You will need to adjust the start times on some of the samples.
Specifically the "Wai" Sample.
I MAY create a more "User friendly" Version but thats up to me.
the alt one should be fine but the alt one is kinda mid ngl
